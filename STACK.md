# Stack of Example Project

<!-- This is an auto-generated file. The stack can be updated by logging into stackety.com and downloading a new STACK.md file for the project: stackety.com/username/stackname -->

A project to showcase Stackety

**Featuring**: Next, Chakra UI, Vercel, Nexus, Next Auth

This is what a project documented on Stackety looks like. There is no need to configure the different parts of the stack. Simply select "React" and it will be added to the Front-End > UI Library section, because we know what the tools are for. You can add extra information about tools such as "Want to add" or "Being added", or comments to indicate to your collaborators what's happening in the stack.

## Front-End

### Language

**graphql-request** - [GitHub](<(https://www.google.com)>)

[**Apollo**](https://www.google.com) ([GitHub](<(https://www.google.com)>))

The SSR configuration was too complicated to integrate to Next, so we switched to React Query, which is much simpler.
